#Arcana overlay
arcana aims to be a solution for automated sanity checking of a Funtoo-based 
distribution. Module-zero is supposed to run sanity-checks against the Funtoo
kits-based portage tree and report possible issues. Ideally, it should be able
to autocorrect some of these.
This overlay contains all the ebuilds containing the different arcana modules
